The Game Runs Using A "while true; do" Loop To Show What Can Be Done Using A Simple Loop.

It Also Showcases A Large "case" Statement.

The Game Is Simple, You Type In The Sector You Want And It Shows A Number, Relative To How Many Bombs Are Touching It, or Bomb "b".

I Did Not Add Any Consequances For Actually Finding A Bomb, or "Mine", I Should Say Since Its Called Mines LoL.

I saw this challenge on a bash game website. I cant remember where. 

It challenged you to use a simple template and then program the Mines into the template.

I did not use there template I just made my own, but the idea for the whole thing started from there.

There are currently THREE LEVELS that are called at random to mix it up i will add more levels when im not adding levels to my other game haha lol.

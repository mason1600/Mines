the game runs using a "while true; do" loop to show what can be done using a simple loop.
it also showcases a large "case" statement.
the game is simple you type in the sector you want and it shows a number relative to how many bombs are touching it or bomb "b".
i did not add any consequances for actually finding a bomb or "mine" i should say since its called mines lol.
i saw this challenge on a bash game website i cant remember where. 
it challenged you to use a simple template and then program the mines into the template.
i did not use there template i just made my own but the idea for the whole thing started from there.

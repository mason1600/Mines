The Game Runs Using A "while true; do" Loop to show what can be done using a simple loop.
It Also showcases a large "case" statement.
The Game is simple, you type in the sector you want and it shows a number, relative to how many bombs are touching it, or Bomb "b".
I did not add any consequances for actually finding a Bomb, or "Mine", I should say since its called Mines lol.
I saw this challenge on a bash game website. I cant remember where. 
It challenged you to use a simple template and then program the Mines into the template.
I did not use there template I just made my own, but the idea for the whole thing started from there.
There are currently THREE LEVELS that are called at random to mix it up i will add more levels when im not adding levels to my other game haha lol.

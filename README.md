The Game Runs Using A "while true; do" Loop To Show What Can Be Done Using A Simple Loop.

It Also Showcases A Large "case" Statement.

The Game Is Simple, You Type In The Sector You Want And It Shows A Number, Relative To How Many Bombs Are Touching It, or Bomb "b".

I Did Not Add Any Consequances For Actually Finding A Bomb, or "Mine", I Should Say Since Its Called Mines LoL.

I Saw This Challenge On A Bash Game Website. I Cant Remember Where. 

It Challenged You To Use A Simple Template And Then Program The Mines Into The Template.

I Did Not Use There Template I Just Made My Own, But The Idea For The Whole Thing Started From There.

There Are Currently THREE LEVELS That Are Called At Random To Mix It Up.
